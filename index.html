      Swami Vivekananda (12 January 1863 – 4 July 1902), born Narendranath Datta, was an Indian Hindu monk, philosopher, author, religious teacher, and the chief disciple of the Indian mystic Ramakrishna. He was a key figure in the introduction of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world, and the father of modern Indian nationalism who is credited with raising interfaith awareness and bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Vivekananda"> <br> Read more on Wikipedia</a>

       <p class="description">
         Swami Vivekananda is best known in the United States for his landmark speech at the 1893 World's Parliament of Religions, introducing Hinduism to America and urging religious tolerance and universal brotherhood. He began his speech with the opening line,<strong> "My brothers and sisters of America,"</strong> which stunned everyone, and he received a standing ovation from the audience for the opening phrase.

It fills my heart with joy unspeakable to rise in response to the warm and cordial welcome which you have given us.

       Swami Vivekananda had prophesized that he would not live to the age of forty. He went about his daily work of teaching Sanskrit grammar to his students at Belur Math on July 4, 1902. At 7:00 pm, Vivekananda retired to his room and requested not to be disturbed. He passed away at 9:20 p.m. while meditating. Vivekananda's disciples claim that he attained 'Mahasamadhi' and was cremated on the banks of the Ganges.
